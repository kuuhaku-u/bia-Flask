## Introduction

The Sign Language Recognition System is an application designed to recognize sign language gestures and translate them into text or speech. This repository contains the backend code that powers the system's functionality.

## Features

- **Gesture Recognition:** The backend implements a robust gesture recognition algorithm capable of identifying sign language gestures captured by the frontend.
- **API:** Exposes an API that the frontend uses to send captured gesture data for recognition and receive recognition results.
- **Data Processing:** Utilizes both Node.js and Python components for gesture recognition and backend logic.
